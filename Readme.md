# LLM Code Generator 

This project leverages a **DeepSeek R1 Distill Llama 70B** to generate Rust projects based on user prompts. The generated code is automatically parsed and saved in a structured repository format.

##  Project Overview

### ðŸ”¹ Features:
- Accepts user prompts to generate Rust projects.
- Automatically structures project files (`Cargo.toml`, `src/main.rs`, etc.).
- Saves the generated files in the repository.
- Ensures proper formatting and error handling.

**NOTE**
- Here I have integrated a knowledge base which is based on the indexing question and keywords created from the data [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/learn-rust).
- The rust compiler is being integrated into this project.So now it sends error back to the llm and model iterates over the code and fix the errors.
- It is not performing very good on complex project.
