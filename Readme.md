# LLM Code Generator 🚀

This project leverages a **Qwen2.5 Coder 7b model** to generate Rust projects based on user prompts. The generated code is automatically parsed and saved in a structured repository format.

## 📜 Project Overview

### 🔹 Features:
- Accepts user prompts to generate Rust projects.
- Automatically structures project files (`Cargo.toml`, `src/main.rs`, etc.).
- Saves the generated files in the repository.
- Ensures proper formatting and error handling.

**NOTE**

- Currently the rust compiler has not been integrated in the project for sending the errors to the llm again. 
- I am figuring out the best way to store the context for the fast retrieval for the qwen model.
